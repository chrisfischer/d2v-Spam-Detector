# doc2vec Spam Detector
Data sets found [here](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/).

Used gensim's open source doc2vec implementation and tensorflow. Achieved 96% validation accuracy with three layer NN.

### TODO
* Better preprocessing
* Use RNN in combination with doc2vec
* Possibly add CNN over word vectors
